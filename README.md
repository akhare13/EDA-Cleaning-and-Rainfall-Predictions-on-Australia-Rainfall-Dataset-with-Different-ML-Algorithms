# EDA-Cleaning-and-Rainfall-Predictions-on-Australia-Rainfall-Dataset-with-Different-ML-Algorithms
In this file I have analysed Australia rainfall dataset using numpy, pandas, matplot, seaborn libraries. Also used Machine Learning Classification Models for predicting the rainfall.
Some Keywords:

Numpy: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for
fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical
operations, random simulation and much more.

Pandas: Pandas is mainly used for data analysis. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel.
Pandas allows various data manipulation operations such as merging, reshaping, selecting, as well as data cleaning, and data wrangling features.

Matplot: Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays
and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.

Seaborn: Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.
Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data.

Difference between Seaborn and Matplot Libraries:
1. Seaborn vs matplotlib is that seaborn utilises fascinating themes, while matplotlib used for making basic graphs.
2. Seaborn contains a few plots and patterns for data visualisation, while in matplotlib, datasets are visualised with the assistance of lines, scatter plots,
pie charts, histograms, bar-graphs, etc. This is another difference between seaborn vs matplotlib.
3. Seaborn vs matplotlib is that seaborn is more agreeable in taking care of data frames in Pandas, while matplotlib is very much associated with Pandas and NumPy and goes
about as a graphics package for Python data visualisation.
4. Seaborn vs matplotlib is that seaborn tries not to cover plots with the assistance of its default themes, while matplotlib is profoundly robust and customised.
5. Seaborn is considerably more organised and functional than Matplotlib and treats the entire dataset as a solitary unit. It isnâ€™t so stateful, and in this manner,
parameters are required while calling techniques like plot (), while Matplotlib acts productively with data arrays and frames. It regards the aces and figures as objects.
It contains different stateful Application Programming Interface for plotting. Accordingly, plot () like strategies that can work without parameters is another difference
between seaborn vs matplotlib.

I have used Supervised Learning Algorithm.
Therefore some knowledege about Supervised Learning Algorithms:
Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model. The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find
a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y).

Algorithms I have used are: Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-Nearest-Neighbours Classification Algorithm,
The information regarding these algorithms is present in code file.
